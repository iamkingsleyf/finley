# Finley child theme

## Notice

Finley is not an "official" release. There are no fancy widget areas, no support for a bunch of plugins etc. This is the theme I built for myself for use on WPCanada some time ago. Since I'm no longer using it I thought I would turn it loose in the wild for anyone who wants to check it out. 

## Installation

1. Upload the Finley child theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well.)

2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.

3. Activate the Finley child theme.

4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Genesis > Theme Settings and configure them to your liking.

## Note

After you download and unarchive the theme from GitHub, you may want to rename the finley-master folder to finley.

## Image Sizes

## Support

Finley is offered without support. Unlike our other child themes, Finley is not an "official" release. I just thought some folk may like to try it out.

Enjoy!
