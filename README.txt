FINLEY CHILD THEME

NOTICE
	Finley is not an "official" release. There are no fancy widget areas, no support for a bunch of plugins etc. This is the theme I built for myself for use on WPCanada some
	time ago. Since I'm no longer using it I thought I would turn it loose in the wild for anyone who wants to check it out.

INSTALLATION

	1. Upload the Finley child theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well).
	2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
	3. Activate the Finley child theme.
	4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Genesis > Theme Settings and configure them to your liking.

Note: After you download and unarchive the theme from GitHub, you may want to rename the finley-master folder to finley.

IMAGE SIZES

Finley uses the following image sizes:

	1. small-square (100x100)
	2. square (120x120)

SUPPORT
	Finley is offered without support. Unlike our other child themes, Finley is not an "official" release. I just thought some folk may like to try it out.

Enjoy!
